 RtoolDS is a ROM Management and Cart Transfer Utility.
 It compliments NDScsc (or not if you don't use it).
 It has been written to be all about copying to your cart as a lot of other
 programs are just about ROM management.
 It currently runs on Windows Platforms, but I’ve had success running it on
 Linux and OS X.
 If you liked RTool64 for the Nintendo 64, then you should like this (as I
 wrote that too).

 Current Features
   Nice GUI with Icons, In-Game and Case graphics
   Automatic Game Save Copying and Backups
   Supports Safe File Trimming
   Works with Uncompressed, Zip, 7-Zip and Rar Files
   Various Filtering Options
   Can maintain it’s own database or use NDScsc’s (to save time and duplication)
   Downloads all Rom information (thanks to Advanscene)
   Custom Tags for ROMs (Think of Lists)
   And more when I think of it.

 RToolDS is currently in a private alpha test phase, but things are
 progressing well.
